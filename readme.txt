Increase your Visibility and Blog Traffic. This plugin allows you to write a WordPress blog and cross-post it to your blog at BestThinking.com.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to write your blog posts in WordPress and have the post automatically reproduced in your [BestThinking.com](http://www.bestthinking.com) blog. Once the plugin is installed and working, no further action is required on the BestThinking side. On the WordPress side, you can decide individually which post will appear on BestThinking. Edits made on the WordPress post are automatically made to the BestThinking post, but not the reverse.

One of the best ways to ensure the success of your blog is to quickly raise your visibility. Keep your own website and blog and generally keep doing everything you are doing as an individual. This will continue to be effective when people search for you by name. But the real additional benefit that can make all the difference comes when you are at the top of the search results for searches by topic or generic terms. This is where BestThinking.com delivers unprecedented results.

An ongoing presence on BestThinking greatly increases visibility of bloggers, writers and ebook authors through extraordinary search engine results, a highly effective blogging platform, article publishing, a speakers bureau and content syndication in association with the likes of content from The Associated Press, Discovery Network (HowStuffWorks.com), etc.  

Registration and identitity verification are required to post blogs on [BestThinking.com](http://www.bestthinking.com). There is no cost to create an account at BestThinking.com.
